Welcome to this ShadCN tutorial! This guide will introduce you to ShadCN, a framework-agnostic library for building accessible and modern web components. Whether you're new to ShadCN or looking to refine your skills, this tutorial covers its fundamentals, installation, and usage.

## What is ShadCN?

ShadCN is a utility library designed to simplify the development of web components that are:

- **Accessible**: Meets ARIA standards and works with assistive technologies.
- **Customizable**: Offers flexibility to match your design system.
- **Framework-Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

## Why Use ShadCN?

## Setting Up ShadCN

Follow these steps to set up ShadCN in your project:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn installed.

### Installation

1. Install ShadCN using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install shadcn-ui
# or
yarn add shadcn-ui
```

2. Import ShadCN components into your project:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'shadcn-ui';
```

## Building Your First Component

Let’s build a simple button using ShadCN.

### Example: Button Component

```jsx
import { Button } from 'shadcn-ui';

export default function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Button onClick={() => alert('Button Clicked!')}>Click Me</Button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Customizing the Button

You can customize components using props or overriding styles:

```jsx
<Button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Custom Button
</Button>
```

## ShadCN Components

ShadCN offers a variety of pre-built components, including:

- **Accordion**
- **Dialog**
- **Dropdown**
- **Tabs**
- **Tooltips**

Here’s an example using the Accordion component:

### Example: Accordion

```jsx
import { Accordion } from 'shadcn-ui';

export default function FAQ() {
    return (
        <Accordion>
            <Accordion.Item title="What is ShadCN?">
                ShadCN is a utility library for accessible components.
            </Accordion.Item>
            <Accordion.Item title="Why use ShadCN?">
                It simplifies creating accessible and customizable web components.
            </Accordion.Item>
        </Accordion>
    );
}
```

## Accessibility Features

ShadCN is designed with accessibility in mind:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Supports intuitive keyboard controls.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Automatically adds ARIA roles and properties.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Works seamlessly with screen readers.

## Integrating with Tailwind CSS

ShadCN can be customized further using Tailwind CSS:

1. Install Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
```

2. Configure Tailwind in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
};
```

3. Use Tailwind classes in ShadCN components:

```jsx
<Button className="bg-green-500 text-white hover:bg-green-700">Tailwind Button</Button>
```

## Conclusion

ShadCN simplifies the development of accessible, modern web components. By leveraging its robust features and combining them with tools like Tailwind CSS, you can create visually appealing and highly usable interfaces. Keep exploring ShadCN to unlock its full potential.
